  </h1>
  <p>I am a Bangladeshi Frontend Web Developer and soon-to-be Masters student at Queenâ€™s University in Canada. I love web technology and learning new things. and I wish to help create an accessible web for everyone.</p>
  <p>In research I am facsinated by AI but am very skeptical of usage of technology without understanding its ethical ramifications. I wish to delve into the ethics of AI and help create a sustainable ecosystem of accessible knowledge on the risks of using AI in our systems.</p>
