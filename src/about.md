# About me

Hi, my name is Mustabeen. :wave: My pronouns are _they / them_.

I am a Bangladeshi Frontend Web Developer. I love web technology and learning new things. and I wish to help create an accessible web for everyone.

:zap: Currently I am working at [XenWorks](https://xen.works/), a startup in Dhaka developing retail solutions. At work I mainly use Typescript and React along with TailwindCSS sprinkled in. I specialize in creating beautiful UI.

:pencil2: I also love researching into AI and AI ethics (as much as one can 'love' prophecizing the AI apocalypse). I wish to one day see a world where the information is more transparent as to the capabilities of AI, and we use the technology in a more responsible manner.

:sparkle: I also _LOVE_ to cook. I love experimenting with new dishes and techniques and post everything I do on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rohanroasts/).

If you want to contact me for professional reasons, [my email](mailto:rohankhan170@gmail.com) is the best place to reach me.
